# About
Windhelm is a text-based role-playing game built with the Windows Batch Script language. You are tasked with recovering your memories and pieces of your soul—shards.\
Create your desired character with the in-depth character creation tool, each choice you make contributes to the story and your character's abilities.\
Progress through the world and learn more about the mysterious forest you find yourself in. Clues can be obtained from passing conversations with NPCs,
encounters with bosses or tattered books you find during your travels.\
More information about mechanics or enemies can learned through gameplay.

## Playing and requirements
You may play Windhelm by either cloning this repository or choosing a release from the releases page.
It is recommended to download and play the packaged release as this repository is in active development.

Windhelm has been tested and confirmed to work properly on command line version 10.0.1.
**Recommended Command Prompt settings:**
+ Recommended font: Consolas
+ Recommended font size for proper scaling: 16

Windhelm also requires VBScript for several tasks, inclduing the animated level transitions but will function without it.

Windhelm does not function as intended under WINE on Linux, but it hasn't been tested thoroughly and the issues encountered may be resolved through configuration changes.
