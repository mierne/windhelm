# About Windhelm
Delve into the powerful, mysterious Iridescent Forest of the Kingdom of Fulkwinn and it's equally powerful castle - Windhelm.
Discover shards of your past, rebuild your identity or forge a new one. Take on the threats to the Iridescent Forest, defending it from those who wish it harm.
Use soul memories to learn about the world around you and potentially form new allies.

## Game Mechanics
Windhelm currently has few gameplay mechanics which have been refined (and will continue to be) over the years the project has existed.
As of now you can currently:
- Create, Save and Load character data.
- Choose from four different races and three different classes, each with their own benefits.
- Merchants which can sell the Player items, this fuels the in-game economy.
- Health, Stamina, Magicka, Armor and XP systems.
- Multiple currency system.
- Player levels and reward system.
- Windhelm's own Combat Engine, allowing for limitless enemies and unique abilities and outcomes.

Please note the above description is based on the current, 0.1.0 Pre Alpha version of Windhelm and any described mechanics may be changed or removed entirely.
You should also be warned that this project discuses difficult and sensitive topics and is not for suitable for all audiences despite the text only nature.
Not all of the features listed above are complete or are in a perfectly stable state.
